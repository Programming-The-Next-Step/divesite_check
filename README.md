# divesite_check
Find dive sites everywhere in the world, weather forecasts for these, and any recent interesting sightings in the area.


This web app displays the diving spots around any location in the world on a Google map. Clicking on a diving spot shows a weather forecast diagram.

The data displayed is obtained from the below APIs:

- Google maps places API
- Dive sizes API api.divesites.com
- National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration weather data from https://api.weather.gov/

For the GUI R Shiny is used. Python is the programming language for communication with the above APIs. 

Depending on how much time I will have, I will other features such as closest whale sightings to the dive site.
